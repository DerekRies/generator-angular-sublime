## Generator-Angular-Sublime

This is a Sublime Text 2 plugin that supports the features provided by the generator-angular yeoman generator. Instead of having to tab out of sublime, open up a terminal, then enter in exhaustingly long "yo angular:route myroute", then tab back into sublime, and finally open up the files that were created; just open up the command palette, type route, enter a name, and let the plugin do the rest.

This is just something I hacked together because I was getting a little fatigued by the experience described above. It only supports the scaffolding commands once the app has already been created at the moment. Should have the ability to create new angular apps from sublime soon as well.
